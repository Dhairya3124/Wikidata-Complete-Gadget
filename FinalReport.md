## Project Description:
The WikidataComplete Gadget is a **[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)** gadget that is intended to help users in adding more facts to the Wikidata knowledge base. 
The tool is fetching suggestions from an API and shows them to the user directly within the Wikidata Web frontend, s.t., adding more facts is becoming convenient.
The suggestions are computed automatically from other sources (e.g., Web Content, Knowledge Bases).

## Experiences of Google Summer of Code 2021
### Community Bonding Period
I had a great experience with Google Summer of Code 2021. I made some new friends during the community bonding period,not only from my organisation also from other organisation. It was really a great and new experience with such a great group of people who have similiar interests. I learnt not only new things about programming but also other important things such as how to ace the interviews & grab new reasearch opportunities at great institutions.

### Coding Period
The coding period was the best time for me to learn and apply new concepts to my project. I was really nervous at the start of the coding period but my mentors supported and helped at every problem I got stuck. They are the best mentors I have ever got.
In this period I learnt about working with REST APIs. I used Wikidata APIs and Wikidatacomplete APIs at every function of the project. 
All this couldn't be done without the support and guidance from my mentors :hearts:.

## Outcomes:
The project UI is created to make Wikidata Editors to be comfortable this gadget comfortable with the Wikidata Users.

## What's Next? 
I'll be contributing this project and improve it's performance and UI . It needs more feature such as editing of the 
evidence, less reloads while embedding to the Wikidata.
## Final Note:
I would like to thank Google and WikiMedia Foundation for such a great program experience.

I would also like to thank my mentors [Dennis Diefenbach](https://github.com/D063520),[Andreas Both](https://github.com/anbo-de),[Aleksandr Perevalov](https://github.com/Perevalov),[Kunpeng Guo](https://github.com/gabinguo) for guiding and supporting me throughout the program.
